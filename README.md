# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
 This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify tweets as positive or negative based on their content.
 Sentiment analysis can provide insights into public opinion and is widely used in various applications, including market research, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive or negative. The dataset includes the following columns:
- `target`: The sentiment of the tweet (0 = negative, 1 = positive)
- `id`: The unique identifier for the tweet
- `date`: The date and time the tweet was posted
- `flag`: The query used to obtain the tweet (if any)
- `user`: The username of the person who posted the tweet
- `text`: The text of the tweet

### Project Structure
The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Downloading the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Assigning appropriate column names.
   - Handling missing values and preprocessing the target column for binary classification.

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Converting text to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters.
   - Removing stopwords and applying stemming to reduce words to their root forms.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Vectorizing the preprocessed text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Splitting the data into training and test sets.
   - Training a logistic regression model on the training data.
   - Evaluating the model's accuracy on both the training and test sets to ensure it generalizes well.

### Key Components
- **Stemming Function:** A custom function to preprocess and stem the text data.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Used to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
- **Logistic Regression Model:** A linear model used for binary classification of tweet sentiments.

### Results
The model is evaluated on both the training and test sets to measure its performance. The accuracy scores on the training and test sets indicate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

### Acknowledgements
Special thanks to the creators of the Sentiment140 dataset for providing a valuable resource for sentiment analysis research.

### Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting the logistic regression model's parameters, such as the regularization strength, to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
- **Advanced Preprocessing:** Incorporating techniques such as lemmatization or more sophisticated tokenization methods.
- **Model Comparison:** Comparing the logistic regression model with other machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models to achieve better performance.
